# OBVIEWS (our Final Project)

Website : https://obviews.herokuapp.com

This app is optimised for mobile, which means you should open it on a smartphone !

Alternatively, if you want to view it from a computer, you should right click anywhere on the page > Inspect Element > Toggle device toolbar, and choose a device from the list.

## My role in the project

[Jules](https://github.com/rigomontj) and I worked on the Back-End of the app, while [SÃ©golene](https://github.com/SegoleneAl) and [Ben](https://github.com/BenCmjn) worked on the Front-End.
